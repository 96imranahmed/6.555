%VA_DETECT  ventricular arrhythmia detection skeleton function
%  [ALARM,T] = VA_DETECT(ECG_DATA,FS) is a skeleton function for ventricular
%  arrhythmia detection, designed to help you get started in implementing your
%  arrhythmia detector.
%
%  This code automatically sets up fixed length data frames, stepping through 
%  the entire ECG waveform with 50% overlap of consecutive frames. You can customize 
%  the frame length  by adjusting the internal 'frame_sec' variable and the overlap by
%  adjusting the 'overlap' variable.
%
%  ECG_DATA is a vector containing the ecg signal, and FS is the sampling rate
%  of ECG_DATA in Hz. The output ALARM is a vector of ones and zeros
%  corresponding to the time frames for which the alarm is active (1) 
%  and inactive (0). T is a vector the same length as ALARM which contains the 
%  time markers which correspond to the end of each analyzed time segment. If Fs 
%  is not entered, the default value of 250 Hz is used.

% Input argument checking
%------------------------

% Initialize Variables
%---------------------
frame_length = round(frame_sec*Fs);  % length of each data frame (samples)
frame_step = round(frame_length*(1-overlap));  % amount to advance for next data frame
ecg_length = length(ecg_data);  % length of input vector
